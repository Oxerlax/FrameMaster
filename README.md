# FrameMaster

## Overview
**FrameMaster** is a JavaFX-based bowling score sheet Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows up to five players to enter frame-by-frame results and see real-time scoring. It automatically calculates each player's final score, tracks strike and spare percentages, and persists data for future reference.

## Features (Completed & In Progress)
- ✅ Display a full bowling score sheet with 10 frames for up to 5 players.
- ✅ Allow users to input frame results (strike, spare, open frame, etc.).
- ✅ Show individual frame scores and final score once all frames are complete.
- ✅ Save game data to a Gson file for future analysis.
- 🔄 Add statistics summary (strike % and spare %) viewable on demand.
- 🔄 Improving GUI responsiveness and code structure for better scalability.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **Framework:** JavaFX  
- **Libraries:** Gson (for data persistence)

## Planned UI Features

## Status
Core functionality is working and being tested. GUI code is actively being refactored and cleaned up before full repository upload.  
**Expected public code release:** Late November - Mid December, 2025.
